// Tom's Suite — BALANCE (must not invent motion).
// A body placed exactly at an unstable equilibrium — a cone balanced on its tip, and a cone resting on
// a single rim edge at 45° — with zero velocity and zero spin. This is a real (if precarious) rest, like
// a pencil balanced on its point. The physics contract: with NO disturbance the solver must not inject
// any lateral or tilting impulse. If the silhouette starts drifting/leaning with nothing touching it,
// that is invented motion (the bug). Oracle: over the whole run the body stays put — its origin barely
// moves horizontally and it barely spins.

	// spawned in the wrong place would plummet straight down with no drift and no spin, and a drift-only
