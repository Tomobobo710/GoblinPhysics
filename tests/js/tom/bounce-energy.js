// Tom's Suite — BOUNCE ENERGY.
// A physical settle only LOSES energy, so each bounce apex must be no higher than the previous one.
// We drop several bodies and track every apex (the height at which upward velocity crosses back through
// zero). If any apex comes out higher than its predecessor, energy was injected — a resting-velocity
// clamp or bad restitution snapping mid-settle. The check flips red the instant a growing apex appears.
//
// Apex tracking is stateful, held in the predicate's closure and advanced every tick — same headless
// and in-browser.
