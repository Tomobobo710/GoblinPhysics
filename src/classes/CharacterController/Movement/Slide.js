/**
 * Slide velocity EVOLVER — advances one tick of the slide's surface-tracking model (slope accel,
 * friction, steering). Pure: only called from beginStep's MOVE_SLIDE branch, which is only reached
 * when endStep has ALREADY decided this tick is a slide (see the "MOVEMENT STATE DECISION" block
 * in endStep) and has already written the correct starting tangential velocity into gb — including
 * the one-time entry boost (slideBoost), applied there rather than here so it lands on the exact
 * tick the state transition itself is observable, not one tick later. This function does not
 * decide whether to slide — it has no entry gate, no exit gate, no stored flag. It reads gb (this
 * tick's starting velocity, already tangent to groundNormal), advances it one tick, and returns
 * the result.
 *
 * @method _updateSlide
 * @private
 * @param {Object} cmd
