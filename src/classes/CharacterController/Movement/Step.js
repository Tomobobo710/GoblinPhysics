 * PRE-physics: set this tick's horizontal velocity (slope/wall projected) + assists.
 *
 * Aim/sim separation: the movement basis comes from the COMMAND's yaw (`cmd.yaw`) — a per-tick
 * input — not from any persistent "live aim". The live aim belongs to the caller (a camera reads
 * it, never the sim), so replaying commands during reconciliation can't drag the view backward.
 * We record the commanded yaw/pitch as this entity's facing (for getState/avatars) only when the
 * command carries them; a caller that never sets yaw keeps driving facing via look() instead.
 *
 * Also applies platform base velocity into the horizontal move (see the constructor's
 * _baseVelocity comment) immediately before collide-and-slide, so a rider is carried through real
 * swept motion rather than a position teleport.
