// Internal statics for FPSCharacterController: algorithm constants (FPSC) and the private raycast
// helper. LOAD ORDER REQUIREMENT: this file must load AFTER FPSCharacterController.js (which defines
// `Goblin.FPSCharacterController` as the constructor function) — these assignments attach static
// properties onto that function object, so the function must already exist. Nothing at module-load
// time in any other file reads FPSC/`_raycast` before first use (only inside function bodies invoked
// later, e.g. at `new Goblin.FPSCharacterController(...)` time), so this ordering is safe. See
// gulpfile.js's buildOrder comment for the explicit ordering this depends on.

// Internal algorithm constants — the thresholds/epsilons/factors baked into the controller's collision,
// grounding, slope and ghost math. These are NOT caller-facing feel knobs (those live in
// FPS_CONTROLLER_DEFAULTS); they are implementation tolerances kept named here so nothing is a bare literal
// at a use site. Changing them changes solver behavior — treat as internals, not tuning.
